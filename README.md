# LRT Jabodebek - Bekasi Line Schedule Viewer 🚆

A simple, fast, and easy-to-use web-based schedule viewer for the LRT Jabodebek Bekasi Line (Jati Mulya ↔ Dukuh Atas BNI). This project provides a clean interface to check the weekday train timetable without needing to open PDF or image files.

## 🌟 Features

- **Complete Weekday Schedule:** View the full weekday timetable for trips in both directions.
- **Direction Toggle:** Easily switch between the "Jati Mulya → Dukuh Atas BNI" and "Dukuh Atas BNI → Jati Mulya" schedules with a single click.
- **Responsive Table:** The schedule is presented in a clean, scrollable table that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No installation or build steps are required.

## 🤔 Motivation

This project was created to provide a quicker and more user-friendly way to check the LRT schedule compared to downloading and zooming into the official schedule images. The data was manually transcribed from the images provided by the operator.

## 🚀 How to Use

Simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
